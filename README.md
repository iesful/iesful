# Hello!

My name is **Ivan**, I'm currently a senior at UHCL studying **Information Technology** and **CyberSecurity**.
- I have a passion for programming and the IT sector.
- Crime and InfoSec podcasts
- Gaming

As I work on medium-large sized projects, I will be uploading them to my profile.
Some repositories are private and will become public as I work through them.
